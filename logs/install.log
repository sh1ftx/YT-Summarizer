───────────────────────────────────────── INSTALAÇÃO E FUNCIONAMENTO DO PYTHON ─────────────────────────────────────────

Introdução

Nesta aula, o professor Gustavo Guanabara explica como o Python funciona e como instalá-lo.  A aula possui parte teórica
e prática.

Conceitos Fundamentais de Linguagens de Programação

Analogia da tradução:

O professor usa a analogia de uma conversa entre uma pessoa que fala português e outra que fala grego para explicar como
linguagens de programação funcionam.  A comunicação direta é impossível sem um intermediário.

Opções de comunicação:

Usar um dicionário (lento e ineficiente).
Usar um intérprete (mais eficiente).  O intérprete entende ambos os idiomas e traduz a mensagem.


A linguagem de programação atua como intérprete:

Ela traduz o código (escrito em linguagem humana) para linguagem de máquina (zeros e uns).
É importante usar uma linguagem clara e concisa para evitar problemas de interpretação.
Gírias e expressões regionais podem causar erros.

Instalação do Python

Sistemas Operacionais:

Linux: Geralmente já vem com o Python instalado.
Mac: Geralmente já vem com o Python instalado.
Windows:  Não vem instalado por padrão; a instalação é necessária.

Passos para instalar o Python no Windows:

1. Abra um navegador e acesse python.org.
2. Vá para a seção "Downloads".
3. Escolha a versão do Python (recomenda-se o Python 3).
4. Baixe o instalador para a versão de 64 bits (x86-64).
5. Execute o arquivo baixado.
6. Durante a instalação, marque a opção "Add Python to PATH" para facilitar o uso do Python no terminal.
7. Conclua a instalação.
8. Feche e abra novamente o prompt de comando.
9. Verifique a instalação digitando "python --version" no terminal.


Passos para instalar o Python no MacOS:

1. Abra um navegador e acesse python.org.
2. Vá para a seção "Downloads".
3. Baixe a versão MacOSX do Python 3.6 (ou versão mais recente).
4. Execute o instalador.
5. Siga as instruções na tela para concluir a instalação.

Passos para instalar o Python no Linux (usando apt-get):

1. Abra o terminal.
2. Execute o comando: `sudo apt-get install python3.6` (ou o comando apropriado para sua distribuição Linux).

Python Zen:

Após a instalação, o comando `import this` exibe o Zen do Python, um conjunto de princípios de design da linguagem.


IDLE (Integrated Development and Learning Environment)

O IDLE é um ambiente integrado de desenvolvimento que acompanha a instalação do Python.  Ele oferece:

Colorização de sintaxe: Facilita a leitura e identificação de erros.
Ajuda contextual: Auxilia o programador com sugestões.

Uso do Interpretador

O interpretador Python permite executar comandos diretamente no terminal ou no IDLE.  Exemplos:

`print("Olá, mundo!")`
`2 + 5`


Conclusão

A aula demonstra a instalação e os primeiros passos com o Python, incluindo a utilização do interpretador e o IDLE.  
Incentiva os alunos a continuar o curso e a apoiar o projeto.
